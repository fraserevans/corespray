# corespray
A python packaged for sampling a distribution function for stars that have been ejected from a star cluster's core

To install clustertools, simply clone the GitHub repository and install via setup tools:

git clone https://github.com/webbjj/corespray.git 
cd clustertools 
python setup.py install 

Please note that if you don’t have permission to write files to the default install location (often /usr/local/lib), you will either need to run

sudo python setup.py install 

or

python setup.py install --prefix='PATH' 

where ‘PATH’ is a directory that you do have permission to write in and is in your PYTHONPATH.
